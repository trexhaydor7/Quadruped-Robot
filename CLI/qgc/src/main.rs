/*  I want QGC (Quadruped Guidance Computer)to take configurations from Raspberry files and other custom config files for my quadruped robot.
Then it will report them in a structure format for reading critical metrics/debugging. I also want it to have a mode to actually control
the robot, including using simple commands for single motors all the way to moving the leg to a specific point using inverse kinematics. 
Above all, it must be a terminal tool, have easy debugging, extensive documentation, optimized for speed and memory usage, and intuitive to use.
