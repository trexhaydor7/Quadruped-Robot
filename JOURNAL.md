## 10/26/2025 - Prototyped Parts  

I prototyped the servo mount and upper linkage (_femur_) for the **MG996R Hi Torque Servo Motors** that I will be using, utilizing **M3 screws and bolts** to make a more robust build. It took a while to design the servo mount because I spent a lot of time reiterating on the mounting choice (initially I was going to use heated inserts), but bolts will be the most reliable for now. After this I hope to design the lower linkage (_tibia_) of the robot and also the hip mechanism, which could use a differential or some variation.

## 10/31/2025 - Improved Femur Part  

Today, I reiterated on the femur design, **majorly** improving both the **structural aspects**, **functionality** (added room for the second room for controlling the tibia), and the technical side of my **CAD software**, Fusion 360, by assigning more variables for redundant values, using appropriate joints, etc. I think I did a good job of working out the screw tolerances to mount the servo motor to the femur shell. However I think I can work on the strength of the part, as there seems to be some excess support where not need and lack of support for other, more critical areas (mounting holes, pivot points, etc.). Next I plan to work on finally finishing a prototype for the entire leg and get started on a list of electronics for my custom PCB. Stay tuned!

Made a ton of progress on the design, including the two-bar linkage, the tibia, and all the joints in between. I had to modify a lot of the mounting holes and such from the previous design, but looks much cleaner and simpler than before. I also had a bit of trouble with designing the two-bar linkage, but it came out quite well, as shown below, and works pretty well (I'm still ordering parts but I will test out the mechanism soon).

A note to make is that I had to cut little plastic parts off the servo motor mounting holes so that it can mount properly.

Soon, after I fix some of the problems with the CAD, I will start coding the inverse kinematics. I will start with a geometric approach but in the future will move on to a more complex but reliable numerical method of calculating endpoints. Furthermore, I plan to use the Jetson Orion Nano in the future to actually control the robot, but I think I will start by just using an Arduino or Raspberry Pi for experimentation and prototyping. Will keep you updated on how it goes!
