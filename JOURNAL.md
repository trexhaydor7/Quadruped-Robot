## 10/26/2025 - Prototyped Parts  

I prototyped the servo mount and upper linkage (_femur_) for the **MG996R Hi Torque Servo Motors** that I will be using, utilizing **M3 screws and bolts** to make a more robust build. It took a while to design the servo mount because I spent a lot of time reiterating on the mounting choice (initially I was going to use heated inserts), but bolts will be the most reliable for now. After this I hope to design the lower linkage (_tibia_) of the robot and also the hip mechanism, which could use a differential or some variation.

## 10/31/2025 - Improved Tibia Part  

Today, I reiterated on the femur design, **majorly** improving both the **structural aspects**, **functionality** (added room for the second room for controlling the tibia), and the technical side of my **CAD software**, Fusion 360, by assigning more variables for redundant values, using appropriate joints, etc. I think I did a good job of working out the screw tolerances to mount the servo motor to the femur shell. However I think I can work on the strength of the part, as there seems to be some excess support where not need and lack of support for other, more critical areas (mounting holes, pivot points, etc.). Next I plan to work on finally finishing a prototype for the entire leg and get started on a list of electronics for my custom PCB. Stay tuned!
