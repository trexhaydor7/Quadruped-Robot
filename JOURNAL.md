## 10/26/2025 - Prototyped Parts  

I prototyped the servo mount and upper linkage (_femur_) for the **MG996R Hi Torque Servo Motors** that I will be using, utilizing **M3 screws and bolts** to make a more robust build. It took a while to design the servo mount because I spent a lot of time reiterating on the mounting choice (initially I was going to use heated inserts), but bolts will be the most reliable for now. After this I hope to design the lower linkage (_tibia_) of the robot and also the hip mechanism, which could use a differential or some variation.
